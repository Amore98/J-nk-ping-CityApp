# JkpgCity Web Development Project
Background
Jönköping has a thriving city core with shops, restaurants, and bars. JkpgCity is a government-owned organization with the mission to develop and promote city commerce. Currently, the JkpgCity web page contains little to no information about ongoing events in the city. This project aims to improve the web presence of JkpgCity by providing a comprehensive and interactive platform for city commerce.
